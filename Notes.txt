Things to try
	
	Accuracy: (All in terms of scaling, Models did not change)
		Different Scaling Methods .003% Increase
		Different Test Sizes (.2, .25, .3) 1% Increase
		drop "depth" .5% Increase
		Table % and Depth .002% Increase
			Table / (X+Y / 2)
			Depth / (X+Y / 2)
	Script
	
	TableAU
	
	Scale Y target
	
Done:
	
	Scaling:
		MinMax
		Robust
		StandardScale
		
	Regression Models to try:
		Ridge
		KNN
		Bayesian
		Decision Tree
		SVM
		Linear
		
	Remove columns with no correlation
	
Notes for presentation:

	4Cs that effect Diamond quality are:
		Cut - How cut the diamond is.
		Color - How much color you can see in the diamond.
		Clarity - How many imperfections there are. (Such as warps or blemishes)
		Carat Weight - How heavy the diamond itself is.
	
		Cut Tiers range from - 'Fair':0, 'Good':1, 'Very Good':2, 'Premium':3, 'Ideal':4
		Clarity Tiers range from - 'I1':0, 'SI2':1, 'SI1':2, 'VS2':3, 'VS1':4, 'VVS2':5, 'VVS1':6, 'IF':7
		Color Tiers range from - 'J':0, 'I':1, 'H':2, 'G':3, 'F':4, 'E':5, 'D':6

		1 - Table of content
		2 - Objective
		3 - Present the data
		4 - Introduce data with pictures and bullet points
			-Bullet points appear while speaking
				-This reduces distractions and control attention
			-Use graphs and plots to introduce correlations and how the data is.
